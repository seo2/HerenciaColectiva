<h2>Certification can be a valuable addition to your course offerings, but it’s not the right fit for everyone.</h2>



<p>You’ve developed an online program. What do learners get when they finish? Some course creators don’t offer anything more than a “good job” and an automated email encouraging them to sign up for the next course (maybe with a discount code!). Others send a badge that learners can add to their profile. And still others offer a full-fledged certificate of completion to verify that a learner has completed training.</p>



<p>This last option has the most gravitas, and can be highly sought in professional circles. Certification is a valuable way for learners to showcase their achievements and boost their professional credentials. But it’s not the right move for everyone, and making the right choice for your course may not be obvious.</p>



<p>So, is offering <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/certificate-builder/">certification</a> a valuable marketing tool or unnecessary red tape? Here’s how to tell.</p>



<h3>1. Is there already a certification standard in your field?</h3>



<p>Before you start a certification course—or add certification to an existing course—you should start with some market research. Is there already a well-established source for certification in your industry? What reputation does it have? Are there others in your industry offering competing certification, or is this source the gold standard?</p>



<p>Competition is a good thing, but there are definitely some instances where the market simply doesn’t have space for another certification course. This is usually because there’s already a single well-regarded source for certification. Ironically, the more competing certification programs there are, the more likely you can set yourself up as a valid alternative.</p>



<h3>2. Are you accredited, or can you become accredited?</h3>



<p>Let’s be clear: you don’t need to be accredited to offer an online certificate. Accreditation is a way for an outside body to certify your certification course, and as such, it provides a great deal of value for course creators and learners alike. However, you don’t need it, and in some cases, there may not even be a way for you to become accredited, if there’s no outside body qualified to do so.</p>



<p>If you are unaccredited, then the value of your certification will rest on your own brand. If your brand is strong and well-regarded in the industry, than a certificate becomes your official sign-off that a learner has completed your training. If your training course is good, then people may come to recognize that sign-off as enough.</p>



<p>However, if you’re relatively unknown, than accreditation can be a way for another institution to vouch for the quality of your course. There are professional bodies that do this, as well as universities. The downside to this is that gaining accreditation means you have to meet their standards—and that may mean altering your course in ways you don’t like. If doing so is worthwhile to you, then accreditation is a sensible step for increasing your course value.</p>



<h3>3. Will certification from your program be valuable to your learners?</h3>



<p>No two industries are alike, especially when it comes to certification. Some fields are tightly regulated, with extremely high professional standards, and an expectation that professionals will take continuing education courses to maintain their standing. Other fields are more like the wild west: the only proof anyone cares about is what a learner can do.</p>



<p>In general, certification is more valuable in fields where competency is harder to assess, or where the risks of failure are high. Auto mechanics seek certification, for instance, to prove that they know how to keep a vehicle roadworthy. An illustrator, on the other hand, relies on their portfolio of work to prove their skill rather than certification.</p>



<p>If you’re in an industry where ongoing education is mandatory (finance, medicine, etc.), then becoming accredited and offering certification has particular value for your learners. If certification isn’t the standard in your industry, and if it doesn’t help your learners market their skills any better, then it’s probably not worth it.</p>



<h3>4. Will certification boost your credibility or offer a competitive advantage?</h3>



<p>Finally, certification can boost the credibility of your learners, but it can boost your own credibility, too. Offering certification as part of your online course—even if you’re not accredited—can establish your authority over your competitors.</p>



<p>That said, this strategy only works if you’ve actually put the work into generating a high quality certification course. Just slapping a certificate onto your program won’t be impressive unless you’ve done the work to back it up. In many cases, certification can boost <em>perceived</em> credibility because it also boosts <em>actual</em> credibility. People see you as a more authoritative source because you put in the work to be so.</p>



<h3>You don’t need certification to offer a valuable online course, but it can be the cherry on top.</h3>



<p>Some courses aren’t about proving your credentials to others—they’re about personal fulfillment and self-satisfaction. While certification may be attractive and valuable to some, for others it would seem misplaced or even silly. After all, if I’ve just finished your online baking course in cupcake design, I don’t need something showing that I’m not a certified cupcake designer.</p>



<p>In short, certification is so you learners can prove their credentials to others. But a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/14-badge-ideas-to-engage-and-motivate-learners/">badge</a> or other mark of achievement is about personal accomplishment. You should offer your learners some token of completion when they reach a significant milestone—whether that’s a badge, some personal feedback, or a certificate is entirely up to you.</p>

<h2>What is social proof, and why do you need it for your marketing?</h2>



<p>One of the greatest challenges for any business when trying to win over new customers lies in convincing them that they are a worthwhile investment. Most consumers have natural hesitations about making a purchase, particularly when what they&#8217;re buying comes with a high price tag or a significant time commitment. That&#8217;s a good thing for them, but it&#8217;s challenging for you.</p>



<p>When considering ways to address the problem of trust in marketing, your first instinct might be to start talking about how trustworthy you are and what a great course you have to offer. Unfortunately, doing so usually strikes a false note. The next best thing is to start informing the consumer—by writing a blog, creating high-quality downloadable resources, or through video tutorials—so that they can learn for themselves why your course is worth their time and money.</p>



<p>However, <strong>nothing wins over a hesitant customer like a satisfied customer</strong>. When someone without a stake in the game, who shares the concerns and aspirations of your prospective learners, and who has made the same decision they&#8217;re facing speaks up and says &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I made that decision because it worked and I had a good experience,&#8221;&#8230;well! What else is there to say?</p>



<p>In marketing terms, these kinds of remarks are called &#8220;social proof.&#8221; They take the burden of proving the worth of your program off your shoulders, and they place it in the hands of people who are willing to back you up out of sheer good will. It&#8217;s a great tool to use in your marketing, but it can be hard to come by. Here are five different kinds of social proof, and how you can earn it from your learners.</p>



<h3>1. Reviews</h3>



<p>When someone completes your course, prompt them to leave a review at the end. Reviews are most convincing when they are public and unfiltered. They&#8217;re even more convincing when they&#8217;re tied to an external profile, such as Facebook.</p>



<p>Some people are anxious about allowing public reviews on their course, because they worry that a negative comment could damage their image. And they&#8217;re not entirely wrong: a slew of angry reviews will hurt. But a wall of five-star reviews hurts, too, because it raises questions about the integrity of the review system.</p>



<p>So, don&#8217;t panic if you get a few negative ratings. It will make the good ones seem more genuine, and you can always learn from someone&#8217;s bad experience.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> We get a lot of our review from <a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/130248/LearnDash/reviews/">Capterra</a>, and publish the best ones on our social media. Hearing what our happiest customers have to say about us frequently makes our day.</p>



<h3>2. Testimonials</h3>



<p>A <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-get-and-use-testimonials-to-sell-your-course/">testimonial</a> is like a review, but it is one you usually have to solicit personally. If you have a lot of reviews coming in from learners, you may not need to collect any. But if reviews are slow, or if you&#8217;re just getting started, try asking learners or beta testers if they might have a kind word to share about their experience. Let them know that you&#8217;d like to put it on your website and other marketing materials, and ask if you can use their name.</p>



<p>Also, pay attention to positive comments that people make spontaneously. If someone says something great about you in an email, follow up by asking if you can share that on your site. Something as simple as &#8220;Wow, thanks for that! Do you mind if we use that in a testimonial on our site?&#8221; is all you need, and almost everyone says yes. It&#8217;s a great way to get an authentic comment from someone, and they didn&#8217;t have to stop to compose anything themselves.</p>



<h3>3. Case Studies</h3>



<p>Case studies are the most sought after kind of social proof for many businesses. A good case study lets you tell a longer, detailed story about someone&#8217;s experience. The format means you can ask more detailed questions, offer some background on the learner, and follow up about any positive results they gained from achieving certification.</p>



<p>That said, good case studies take extra work to develop. You need to find a learner who will consent to work with you, find time to interview them, and then edit their story into something that&#8217;s attractive and worth sharing. It&#8217;s well worth the effort if you can pull it off, but doing so takes thoughtfulness and persistence.</p>



<p>If you want to write a good case study, keep an eye out for the right candidates. Focus on learners you have established some rapport with, and ask them if they&#8217;d be willing to be interviewed shortly after they complete the course. Make sure they know what you plan to use the case study for, and what the time commitment will be on their part. Be prepared to write it quickly and send it to them for approval. If you can catch people quickly and turn them around fast, you can start building up a collection of case studies from a wide range of learners.</p>



<h3>4. Social Sharing</h3>



<p>Reviews that appear on your website are great social proof for visitors, but social media sharing amplifies that message for people who may not have heard of you yet. Unlike publishing your reviews in your own social channels, which we mentioned earlier, social sharing is about getting your learners to spontaneously share about you in their own channels.</p>



<p>For instance, when your learners complete something in your course, make it easy for them to share it with their network. An enthusiastic student may be eager to share their progress, and in doing so may introduce one of their friends to your course. Word of mouth is a powerful thing.</p>



<h3>5. Badges and Certification</h3>



<p>Having learners post about a test score or a new achievement in their news feeds is excellent, but news feeds are fleeting, and whatever buzz they generate will fade. But what about giving learners something to post in their profiles, where it will be more permanent? On platforms such as LinkedIn, or other online resumes, a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/badgeos/">badge</a> or <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/certificate-builder/">official certificate</a> can be a permanent way for learners to share their achievement.</p>



<p>When learners add their badge or certification credentials to their social media profiles, those credentials stay there for any visitor to see. They might not even remember it&#8217;s there after a while, but their endorsement will remain.</p>



<h3>Social proof is more convincing than anything you can say about yourself.</h3>



<p>Adding the right functions to allow for social sharing, badges, and course reviews may take a little time to set up. But any effort you put into it will be paid back many times by the positive affect of a learner leaving their seal of approval on your course. So, instead of wondering how to convince new learners that your course is worthwhile, turn the microphone over to learners who have already completed it. Their satisfaction will amplify your message far better than you could ever do on your own.</p>

<h2>Your learners have completed your course. How do you retain their interest in your program?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s a truism in the marketing industry that it&#8217;s harder and more expensive to find new customers than to retain the ones you have. This is why so many businesses devote substantial resources to growing customer satisfaction. However, in online education, it&#8217;s all too easy for recipients to get what they came for and walk out the door never to be seen or heard from again.</p>



<p>Growing a customer base with that kind of business model is a challenge, but it&#8217;s not impossible, especially if you’re marketing to a professional industry where learners have ongoing education requirements. However, relying on your learners to automatically choose your course again can be a gamble, especially if you have competitors who might be offering something new and exciting that your learners haven’t tried before. Instead, course creators should find ways to retain learners so that they keep coming back for more—and maybe even spread the word to their friends and family.</p>



<p>Looking for inspiration? Here are 7 ways to engage your learners and build customer loyalty.</p>



<h3>1. Advanced certification.</h3>



<p>Many professions offer progression models so that workers have a clear path to follow if they want to progress in their career. Just as a college offers 100-level classes to first-year students and 400-level classes to seniors, you could consider advanced certification programs for learners that have already passed certain prerequisites.</p>



<p>For instance, you could offer your program to learners who have already passed one of your courses, possess a similar level of certification from one of your competitors, or have a certain number of years&#8217; experience in their trade. This will be a smaller pool than those just starting out, but it&#8217;s also a niche market that is potentially underserved in your industry. Launch an advanced certificate, and you might even draw learners away from the competition.</p>



<h3>2. Micro courses.</h3>



<p>Advanced courses explore a subject more narrowly, but micro courses offer a chance to go broad rather than deep. Maybe your course on SEO could benefit from a micro certification in local SEO. Learners who graduated your main course could come back for the supplementary material, those who are currently taking your course could take it as an add-on, and anyone on the fence could try it out without committing to the full course. Micro courses provide a flexible way to add to the value of your program, and are easier to develop than another full course.</p>



<h3>3. Focused webinars.</h3>



<p>Like micro courses, webinars create an opportunity for learners to engage with material in a new way. They also allow you to connect more personally with your audience. Through a webinar, you can respond to learner questions, create a discussion, and incorporate up-to-the-minute material more rapidly than through a course. And if you record your webinar, you can share it later with learners who weren&#8217;t able to attend.</p>



<h3>4. Content marketing.</h3>



<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard of <a href="https://www.learndash.com/tips-for-creating-a-course-content-marketing-strategy/">content marketing</a>, but if you haven&#8217;t, it&#8217;s a way of building customer trust and loyalty through high-value content such as blogs, podcasts, a video series, or downloadable PDFs.</p>



<p>Content marketing is usually presented as a way to recruit new learners. By writing articles and producing other audio/video material, you give your audience a way to connect with your material, learn about your field, and get a sense of your instructional style. But you also provide a valuable resource for your learners to return to for new insight and information. As long as you keep that connection alive, you have a chance to convince those learners to come back for new courses.</p>



<h3>7. Community.</h3>



<p>We’ve talked about this many times before, but learners frequently turn to online courses <a href="https://www.learndash.com/are-you-selling-courses-or-community/">for community</a> as much as for the material you have to teach. Giving learners a place where they can connect with each other as they work toward their learning goals is a powerful way to keep them engaged with your learning website.</p>



<p>If you don’t have the resources to build a forum yet, you can also create a community on social media. LinkedIn and Facebook both offer private, invite-only groups. What if you created a group for everyone who completed a course from your program to join? Doing so would create a networking opportunity for members, and it would keep your program front of mind.</p>



<h3>6. Newsletter.</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re doing half of any of the above, you should create a newsletter so that you can share all this information with your learners. The newsletter doesn&#8217;t have to be fancy. In fact, it can be as simple as offering to email subscribers new blog posts when they come out, as well as any news on courses as they become available. But if you&#8217;re going to do a newsletter, plan on making it at least monthly, if not weekly. Otherwise, your learners are likely to forget they signed up for it and are more likely to leave your emails unread.</p>



<h3>7. Resource library.</h3>



<p>Over the course of developing your online course, you&#8217;ve doubtless accumulated various resources, original or otherwise. You probably can&#8217;t share everything for copyright reasons, but anything in the public domain—and certainly anything you&#8217;ve developed yourself, could be compiled into a resource library for your learners.</p>



<p>That could include infographics, helpful YouTube videos, white papers, PDFs, or even e-books. And for those resources you can&#8217;t share for free, you could still offer links to books and articles so that your learners know where to go for more information. This isn&#8217;t as dynamic an option as some of the others we&#8217;ve mentioned, but it still has the potential to provide value to your learners, and it&#8217;s relatively easy to assemble.</p>



<h3>Use your course to cultivate lifelong learners.</h3>



<p>If there&#8217;s any unifying theme from the ideas we&#8217;ve presented above, it&#8217;s that learning doesn&#8217;t stop when your learners finish a course. Instead, it&#8217;s an ongoing process that learners should re-engage with throughout their lives. If that&#8217;s the case, there should be plenty of benefits to learners in remaining with your program, even after they complete their first course. All you have to do is give them a reason to stay.</p>

<h2>How do you know if there is a market for your specialized online course?</h2>



<p>One of the biggest struggles first-time educators face when they launch a new course lies in <a href="https://www.learndash.com/choosing-a-topic-for-your-course/">finding a promising subject</a>. They may have an idea that inspires them, but it&#8217;s less certain whether that idea will appeal to anyone else. As a result, the temptation for these course providers is to go broad. With such a wide market, they can&#8217;t help but earn some slice of the pie, right?</p>



<p>The reality is that, by choosing a less-specific subject, they become more generic, and their course becomes lost in a sea of other, similar courses. They may muddle along, but it will be harder to achieve the kind of success they actually aspire to.</p>



<p>On the other hand, by refining a course topic and settling on a niche idea, they stand a better chance of establishing their place as an expert on that subject. There are obviously some pros and cons to choosing a niche idea, but overall it&#8217;s a gamble that&#8217;s likely to pay off. Here&#8217;s why.</p>



<h3>Pro: People identify with a niche course more than with a generic one.</h3>



<p>Niche course ideas resonate more than generic ones. The more refined your idea is, the more that audience will feel your course was designed with them in mind.</p>



<p>And, in a way, it is. By defining your niche, you&#8217;re sending a strong signal to like-minded people that you have something that will fit what they&#8217;re searching for. You could have a course that teaches almost exactly the same thing as one of your competitors, but if you&#8217;ve branded yourself as having created the course for a specific group, members of that group are more likely to sign on.</p>



<h3>Con: A niche online course, by definition, has a smaller market.</h3>



<p>That said, a niche course will have a smaller market than a generic one—that&#8217;s what being &#8220;niche&#8221; means. The key is to ensure you don&#8217;t become overly restricted by the size of your market. If you have an idea for a hyper-specific course, wait until you&#8217;ve grown an audience through your other online programs first, then market your hyper-specific course as a micro course to current students.</p>



<h3>Pro: A smaller market gives you the chance to be a big fish in a small pond.</h3>



<p>If there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any huge players in your niche already, it pays to research market demand for your course. It could be that a few small courses do exist, but that no one has yet cornered the market. In the meantime, maybe you&#8217;ve found a lot of discussion in blogs and online forums indicating an unmet interest.</p>



<p>This is an ideal scenario for your course idea. It means you have an opportunity to establish yourself as the program in the industry for your topic. In that case, your market may be small, but you have space to dominate.</p>



<h3>Con: Niche markets can only sustain so many big fish.</h3>



<p>If there&#8217;s already an established industry leader in your niche market, that could indicate a few things: either the market is saturated, and you&#8217;ll have a tough time competing, or there&#8217;s a strong demand in your niche for online programs, and you can fill that need.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re wondering which scenario applies to you, ask yourself: how is your course different from the industry leader? If you can&#8217;t identify ways in which your course is substantially different, then you&#8217;ll probably be perceived as a copy-cat rather than a thought leader. On the other hand, if you have a strong reason to believe that your course brings something new and valuable to the market, then that&#8217;s a positive sign to proceed.</p>



<h3>Pro: It’s unlikely your niche course idea has reached market saturation.</h3>



<p>Not to be too optimistic, but the market for online programs is only growing. The percentage of the American population with access to broadband Internet it their homes is steadily increasing, and the same is true in other parts of the world as well. This has been accompanied by a rise in the proportion of people who feel comfortable using technology in their day-to-day lives.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, online courses have become an increasingly common way for workers to improve their employment prospects and earning potential. In many cases, organizations use online certification in place of more formal employee training, making it a familiar part of modern work environments.</p>



<p>This is all fantastic news for anyone hoping to launch a certification program or any other kind of course. The market is strong, and it&#8217;s only growing stronger.</p>



<h3>Show your audience the value of your course, price it reasonably, and yes, it will sell.</h3>



<p>The bottom line is: if you&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-vet-your-online-course-idea/">done your homework</a> and identified an online market for your niche, there&#8217;s no reason to believe your topic is too specific. Too many people approach their topic with the idea that &#8220;niche&#8221; means you&#8217;re about to launch a certification course in alpaca farming (although, for the record, it is possible to become a certified fiber sorter).</p>



<p>Unless you&#8217;re actually proposing a highly outlandish online program, you&#8217;ve probably hit upon your course idea because you&#8217;re already part of an interested community. You&#8217;re not alone in your interest, and where there is interest, there&#8217;s a market.</p>



<p>If you’re having trouble selling your course, chances are it has more to do with your value proposition than your niche. Your course needs to connect with a specific end result. A vague promise that your course participants will “learn more” is less captivating than that they will achieve a qualification that will help them advance in a career, or that they will reach a certain goal, or gain a new skill.</p>



<p>So, rather than worrying about your niche, focus on your value proposition. What do learners stand to gain from taking your course? And how much will they be willing to invest toward achieving it? Figure out those puzzle pieces, and your course will take you far.</p>

<h2>Online education for younger learners is a growing market segment, but requires special management tools for parents.</h2>



<p>The youth market for online education has been growing steadily over the past decade, even before Covid–19 turned remote learning into a daily experience for many families around the world, and it’s not hard to understand why. Parents are always looking for new ways to make “screen time” more educational. Teachers are using “blended learning” to integrate in-person learning with take-home assignments. And kids and teenagers often have their own learning interests, too.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/online-learning-for-children-and-young-adults/">creating courses for young learners</a> is not the same as creating courses for adults. For one thing, children and young adults have different learning abilities, motivations, and preferences. And for another, the parents of young learners usually have to be involved.</p>



<p>Fortunately, it is possible to offer parents tools for monitoring their children in an online course so that they can track progress and keep up with their kids’ assignments, while also reducing the administrative burden on your end. Here’s how.</p>



<h3>How to offer parental controls for your online course.</h3>



<p>First of all, some courses don’t need extensive parental controls. For instance, if you’re selling a course for young children who can’t use a device unassisted, parents will already be the primary account holders. Similarly, if parents are signing their older teenagers up for a course, they may not need or want to be monitoring that student’s progress. Or, if they need, to, they can sign in to their child’s account to check progress.</p>



<p>If you do want more advanced options, however, there are three main options available to you: use <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/users-groups/groups/group-users-and-group-leaders/">LearnDash’s native Groups settings</a>, install a 3rd party plugin, or use custom development.</p>



<h4>1. LearnDash’s native Groups function.</h4>



<p>For parents who only need a basic ability to monitor their child’s progress, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-learndash-to-create-a-wordpress-membership-site/">LearnDash’s Groups function</a> that can do just that. As a course creator, you would make each parent a Group Leader, and then assign their children to them as Group Users.</p>



<p>The Group Leader function would let parents view course progress, as well as see reports on quiz performance. It’s important, if using this option, to make sure you have the correct settings and permissions set. You’ll only want to give parents basic capabilities over their groups so that they can manage their children but no one else’s.</p>



<p>That said, the Groups function is primarily designed as a management tool for leaders with larger teams to manage. It can work well for small parent/child courses, but can be clumsy on a large scale.</p>



<h4>2. Parent and Child Access.</h4>



<p>Our recommended solution for most use cases is <a href="https://immerseus.com/parent-access-for-learndash/">Parent and Child Access</a>, which is a 3rd party plugin from Immerseus eLearning.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Link parent account and child accounts.</strong> This can be done in the WP Admin by the admin, or on the front-end by the parent. For large organizations, allowing parents to complete the linking step can save your administrative team a lot of effort.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Monitor each child individually.</strong> Allows parents to see whether a course is started, course progress, lessons taken, quizzes, taken, quiz scores, and certificates.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="337" src="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1-1024x337.png" alt="A screenshot of the Parent and Child Access plugin showing that a student has not started a course." class="wp-image-28382" srcset="https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1-1024x337.png 1024w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1-300x99.png 300w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1-768x252.png 768w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1-1536x505.png 1536w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1-1800x592.png 1800w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1-500x164.png 500w, https://www.learndash.com/wp-content/uploads/parent-dashboard-modal-1.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Parents can check progress for courses, lessons, quizzes, and certificates.</figcaption></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Sell courses to the parent.</strong> Using both WooCommerce and the built-in LearnDash selling methods, you can sell courses directly to parents and then let them link their own child accounts.</li></ul>



<p>There are a number of other plugins on the market that offer membership controls, but Parent and Child Access is the only one built specifically for LearnDash with parental controls in mind. Their solution also works for management teams in organizations, so it’s really worth looking into if you have an internal training application in mind.</p>



<h4>3. Custom development.</h4>



<p>Finally, there is the tried-and-true custom development solution. If your organization has the both the budget for this and a very specific use case in mind, this is the best option. However, the down side of custom development is that it is expensive, and you’ll need to continue to maintain it for yourself. Before you start a custom development project, research you options and be sure that the custom functions you need can’t be covered by the solutions already available.</p>



<h3>Benefits of parent controls in a K–12 online course.</h3>



<p>Offering parents better access to their children’s courses is good for parents, teachers, and young learners. It empowers parents by giving them better insights into their children’s learning progress, it reduces administrative work for teachers, and it helps learners perform better both in person and online. Specifically, these benefits include:</p>



<ul><li>Allowing parents to manage their children’s enrollment reduces the administrative burden of managing an online course.</li><li>Teachers can assign in-class homework which can be completed and submitted at home.</li><li>Online quizzes can provide automatic grading and feedback without adding to teacher workloads.</li><li>Learners can complete extra practice quizzes at home to become more confident in a subject before a big test.</li><li>Parents can check up on their child’s progress anywhere and at any time.</li><li>Greater parental access to student progress can improve communication with teachers.</li><li>Parents can sign their kids up for extracurricular courses that aren’t available it their school.</li></ul>



<h3>Parent access can make the learner experience of online K–12 education better for everyone.</h3>



<p>Over the past year, online education for children and young adults has been rough, and parents are exhausted. Part of what has made this transition difficult, however, has been the abrupt roll-out and lack of support for parents and teachers alike. Offering better tools to help parents stay up to date with their children’s coursework can reduce strain for parents and teachers alike.</p>



<p>Having better tools is important because K–12 online education isn’t going anywhere. The pandemic has seen schools pour resources into technology for students that has expanded Internet access and the availability of computers and tablets to young learners around the world. Furthermore, parents, kids, and educators are all now more familiar with this technology than they were prior to the pandemic.</p>



<p>Once online education is no longer a necessity, many will discover which aspects they want to keep for future learning. Good management tools that empower parents are sure to be one of them.</p>

<h2>Whether you’re feeling overwhelmed or looking for inspiration, here’s a place to start.</h2>



<p>For a lot of course creators, marketing is a love it or hate it activity. It takes time, thoughtfulness, and a lot of brainpower to do right, and it can be discouraging if your efforts don’t seem to be paying off. However, if you’re serious about building your online course, there’s no way around it: this is not an “if you build it they will come” situation. You have to get out there and tell people about your course if you expect to grow an audience.</p>



<p>How do you do that? Here are a few ways.</p>



<h3>1. Flesh out some landing pages on your website.</h3>



<p>When someone comes to your website, what’s the first page they land on? Here’s a surprise: It may not be your home page! A lot of home page visits come from people who already know your brand. They searched for your name online, they followed a link from your social profile page, or they went directly to your web address from your business card.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a lot of organic traffic will land on your site through some other page—a blog post or a product page, for instance. You can capture and retain more of this traffic if you design pages for specific audiences, and then optimize them for more search traffic. To rank, these pages will need to have a lot of text, as well as images, headers, and other rich content (infographics and videos, for instance). Give them love, and position some nice calls-to-action to encourage them to sign up to your course or newsletter.</p>



<h3>2. Write a piece of high-value content and give it away in exchange for email addresses.</h3>



<p>Another way to grow leads (meaning: grow a list of people who have given you their email address because they like your content) is to create a high-value PDF download. This may be an infographic, a worksheet, an article—whatever you like! Just so long as it’s something that will feel “worth it” to your visitors after they go through the trouble of downloading it.</p>



<p>Once your content piece is made, gate it by putting it behind a download form. Ask for a name and email address, and include a check box to ask if you can send them more marketing materials, such as your newsletter or other offers. (Note: For EU users especially, asking permission is essential for staying on the right side of GDPR compliance.)</p>

<h3>3. Begin a blog and include an email sign-up form.</h3>



<p>Designing landing pages is important for your most valuable key terms, but your blog is another important gateway to your site where each page is its own landing page, of sorts. Blogging lets you touch on a rage of niche topics, and over time, it becomes its own valuable resource of content. Be sure to link to your old posts so that prospective learners will stay on your site, and include an email form for your newsletter to retain interested learners.</p>



<h3>4. Email your list regularly with well-designed, thoughtful content.</h3>



<p>There’s a lot of resistance to email newsletters, mostly because a lot of people feel tired and overwhelmed by bad email marketing content. But at the same time, email content that’s <em>good</em> is often popular. There are some newsletters out there with dedicated readers who will swear by it as a resource. That’s the kind of newsletter you want to create.</p>



<p>Remember, people who gave you their email address and agreed to receive your newsletter want to be contacted by you. They want your resource to be a good one. All you have to do is deliver quality as promised.</p>



<h3>5. Choose a couple social media channels that fit your niche and get active.</h3>



<p>You don’t have to be on every social channel. Your audience won’t be everywhere, and you don’t want to waste your energy where it won’t do you any good. But if there’s a channel where you feel comfortable and where you think you can grow an audience, start creating posts.</p>



<p>Remember that each channel is different, and that you may find your audiences on each channel are unique. Audiences on Facebook tend to skew older, and are more likely to comment. Instagram uses a lot of hashtags, and it is worth your time to research which ones are popular for your area. Twitter works best for people who want to build a personal brand, but it takes a lot of savvy to maintain. Choose wisely and be careful where you put your energy.</p>



<h3>6. Put ad money behind your best social posts.</h3>



<p>You can draw more attention to your social media content by “boosting” social posts. You don’t want to do this with every post, but it’s a good idea for special announcements or extra valuable content.</p>



<p>You can also create ads designed to link back to your site’s landing pages. Depending on the social channel, your targeting tools can narrow down those who see your ads to very specific audiences, letting you run niche ads with high conversion rates.</p>



<h3>7. Build networking opportunities at events.</h3>



<p>As you break into your industry, you can raise your profile by reaching out to others in your network. It is hard to do this via cold email (I’ve discarded enough requests to know), but it is possible with personal connections.</p>



<p>Industry events—whether in person or online—are one way to do this. Social media is another avenue. If you’re building connections on Twitter, for instance, you might be able to reach out to someone with whom you’ve had a positive interaction to work on something together. You might ask about guest blogging on each other’s sites. WordCamps, for those in the WordPress sphere, offer opportunities to pitch speaking topic. Do a good job, and you might find someone who wants to interview you for their podcast.</p>



<p>Your own industry may have similar events where speakers can submit topics, although in most cases this is done by invitation. Avoid anyone who is asking you to pay them for an opportunity to speak at their event.</p>



<h3>What NOT to do.</h3>



<p>Finally, there are lots of ways you can go wrong with online marketing, mostly by following bad advice from pushy, old school sales tactics. The Internet is a different space, where most people are quick to block you, mark your emails as spam, or report your content for violating forum rules. If you don’t want to find yourself black listed, here are a few major don’ts.</p>



<ul><li><strong>DON’T start hijacking other people’s content channels.</strong> This includes their blog, their social media channels, and their private forums.</li><li><strong>DON’T spam professional groups with your course.</strong> Speaking of hijacking forums, don’t do this on professional groups, either. Groups on Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Quora are especially quick to call out self-promotion.</li><li><strong>DON’T start adding everyone you know to your email lists.</strong> Email marketing tools&nbsp; will blacklist you if too many people mark your emails as spam.</li><li><strong>DON’T throw your ad money after generic key terms.</strong> High profile key terms are expensive, and often have low conversion rates. Focus on niche terms that are easier to win.</li></ul>



<h3>Online marketing takes time, so start early and be consistent.</h3>



<p>The best online marketing focuses on the long term. Reputations online have staying power, and if you start off with bad tactics that focus on the hard sell or make you look unprofessional you may have trouble ever getting off the ground.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you focus on quality from the beginning and demonstrate your expertise through your marketing from day one, you will not only capture the attention of the people you most want to attract, you will keep them around for the long term.</p>

<h2>Blogging is one of the oldest marketing tools on the Internet—and still one of the best.</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re like many of our users, you may have put hours into developing your course, and are now faced with a common conundrum: how do you attract learners to sign up? Without a pre-established audience, progress might be slow. But there is a proven way to build that audience—and sustain it for years to come.</p>



<p>Yes, I am talking about blogging.</p>



<p>The blog has been a foundation of Internet culture practically since its inception. Some bloggers have become so successful that many of the rest of us discount it as a strategy for ourselves. If you&#8217;re reading this thinking &#8220;I&#8217;m not a blogger, I&#8217;m an educator,&#8221; you might be one of that group.</p>



<p>However, your blog doesn&#8217;t have to be massively popular as a blog to be wildly successful as a marketing tool. Many of these merits are indirect and therefore not obvious to anyone who hasn&#8217;t tried their hand at it. So, if you&#8217;re wondering whether this is a path you should pursue, here are seven reasons why the answer is probably &#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>



<h3>1. Blogging can help you grow an audience and establish your brand.</h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s start with the most basic marketing benefit of blogging: SEO. If you want people to find your website, you need to be showing up in search results. And to show up in search results, you need content. Not course content, because most of that will be gated (unless you set it to &#8220;open&#8221;), but public, discoverable content on your website. The more the merrier.</p>



<p>Blogging is a great way to create content that hits your search terms and draws in a new audience. Furthermore, that blog content can then be share don social media to bring in more traffic. It&#8217;s also a way to establish who you are in your industry—to find a voice and a perspective that sets you apart from your competition. In other words, it lets you define your brand.</p>



<h3>2. Blogging lets you test course ideas and find what resonates.</h3>



<p>Have an idea for a course, but not sure if there&#8217;s any interest? Blog about it. See if people respond. If you get a good reaction, then you can use your blog to continue to grow interest, to keep your readers attention, and to float ideas as you go to refine your idea into something you know your audience wants.</p>



<p>Is the reaction tepid? Well, now you know to scrap the idea before you put too much time into it. Or not! If you&#8217;re really convinced your idea is worthwhile, you could use the blog to drum up interest.</p>

<h3>3. Blogging keeps you up to speed on the industry.</h3>



<p>There&#8217;s nothing like a blog to make sure you have your finger on the pulse of every new development. Blogging forces you to be accountable. You&#8217;re too public to be uninformed about the latest news. More than that, once you fall into the blogging mindset, you&#8217;re constantly looking for new ideas to write about.</p>



<p>And if you get a good idea, writing about it means you&#8217;ll have to go research it and learn more about it to be sure you&#8217;re providing the best information. Blogging keeps you on your toes.</p>



<h3>4. Blogging lets your audience get a taste of your teaching style.</h3>



<p>A lot of learners are hesitant to try something from an unknown source. How do they know you&#8217;re really an expert? How do they know they&#8217;ll like you as a teacher?</p>



<p>Your blog is a great chance to give them a preview of what your classes might be like. Are you charismatic? Does your sense of humor match theirs? Are you delivering information at a high enough knowledge level for them? All these are things they can learn from your blog.</p>



<h3>5. Blogging is an outlet for your big ideas.</h3>



<p>Many of us go into online education because we&#8217;re passionate about our subject matter. We&#8217;re in touch with the industry, and want to share our thoughts and ideas. If this sounds like you, then blogging may be less a marketing task that needs to be completed, and more a welcome relief.</p>



<p>Your blog is where your ideas can live. Publish the thoughts that make you feel inspired, and you&#8217;ll inspire others as well.</p>



<h3>6. Blogging creates additional resources for your students.</h3>



<p>When you publish posts on your blog, they aren&#8217;t lost in the void. On the contrary, they are an archive of your writing and thinking on your subject matter. This means that, if your learners have questions, you have posts ready to share with them. Or, you can take questions from your learners and turn them into blog posts. Either way, you&#8217;re creating more resources for your learners to use as they improve their own skills.</p>



<p>Over time, you may even be able to take the content from your blog and use it to develop a new course!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>Read more: <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-create-a-course-using-a-blog/">How to Create a Course Using a Blog</a></p></blockquote>



<h3>7. Blogging lets you sell your audience on the importance of your subject.</h3>



<p>Finally, not everyone is going to be sold on the need to educate themselves in your subject area. Your blog is a place to convince them otherwise. And you have all the time in the world to do it. There&#8217;s nothing stopping you from discussing the importance of your subject from every angle, and the more you do so, the more you will convince others that taking your course is, indeed worthwhile.</p>



<h3>Blogging doesn’t just help your marketing, it makes your course better as well.</h3>



<p>As we said, blogging isn&#8217;t just about its direct marketing benefits as a driver of inbound traffic. Rather, it&#8217;s also about keeping your mind focused on your course subject matter, and making sure you&#8217;re constantly creating—and demonstrating—value for your learners.</p>



<p>I often compare blogging to exercise. It&#8217;s not something that will change your life immediately. In fact, for a while, you may feel like you&#8217;re putting in a lot of effort and not getting anywhere. But in the long run, it&#8217;s one of the most important things you can do to build the strength of your business. Make it a habit, and the results will follow.</p>

<h2>Keeping learners hooked on your course is a matter of demonstrating ongoing value.</h2>



<p>Every now and then, I hear people claim that online learning is a way to generate “passive income.” The idea seems to be that, once you create a course, you can fully automate everything about it, and it will <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-scale-up-your-learndash-infrastructure/">smoothly scale</a> to serve as many learners who want to take it, and you can sit back and retire to a beach somewhere without having to worry about it every again.</p>



<p>Of course, those who have actually built an online course often feel like the reverse is true: They create some excellent content, put it out into the world, but struggle to attract and retain new learners. It’s frustrating and disheartening.</p>



<p>The truth is that building a course takes work, and selling courses often means continually creating new content and updating old. Learners need to see ongoing value in your course to remain committed, but it is sometimes difficult to find new ways to provide that value.</p>



<p>Fortunately, value comes in many different forms, from <a href="https://www.learndash.com/tips-for-writing-smarter-e-learning-quizzes/">extra quizzes</a> to <a href="https://www.learndash.com/choosing-the-right-feedback-strategy-for-your-online-course/">personal feedback</a>. And the more creative you are with the value you provide, the more intrigued learners will be about your course. So, if you’re looking for inspiration, here are 8 ideas to add value to your online course.</p>



<h3>1. Pose weekly challenges for users of varying skill level.</h3>



<p>One of the best ways to keep learners engaged is to give them something to do regularly. Unless your ask is very short, a daily challenge is something many users might drop out of. On the other hand, a monthly challenge may be too spread out for learners to feel engaged. A weekly challenge (solving a puzzle, completing a creative prompt, achieving a goal) gives learners something to latch on to and provides motivation and a sense of progress.</p>



<h3>2. Offer time slots to connect virtually.</h3>



<p>Individual feedback is the least scalable part of an online course, but also one of the most valuable. If you’re a personal coach or mentor, offering a time slots to discuss a learner’s individual needs may be one of your most profitable—and popular—online services.</p>



<h3>3. Organize small groups to build community.</h3>



<p>Online learners crave connection—not just with you, but with their peers. I’ve joined several online classes where the most exciting aspect was the chance to connect with others who were learning the same skill as me. However, one of the downsides to this is that, without facilitation from the group leader, connecting with classmates can be awkward and may not happen. If, as the leader of your course, you take the time to organize thoughtful <a href="https://www.learndash.com/run-effective-group-projects-online-education/">group projects</a>, it can be a way to help your learners work together and build meaningful social connections at he same time.</p>



<h3>4. Create special limited-run micro courses.</h3>



<p>One of the secrets to selling more courses is to only offer them for a limited time. Many learners will put off singing up for a course if it’s always available. But if you put out a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-micro-learning-in-your-course/">micro course</a> on an interesting or timely topic, it motivates learners to sign up.</p>



<h3>5. Maintain a regular blog and email updates to your learners.</h3>



<p>Blogs are, of course, public—and they should be an ongoing part of your content marketing strategy. But they also give learners a reason to keep taking your course. A blog keeps your content current, and is a public demonstration of your continued expertise in your field. Coupled with an email mailing list, it’s a way engage your learners and inspire them with new ideas and insight.</p>



<h3>6. Use gamification to add motivation and accountability.</h3>



<p>Many learners struggle to stay engaged with a course after a certain period of time. They need a reason to check in, and they need something to hold them accountable when they don’t. Gamification elements, like streaks or leaderboards, can do both.</p>



<h3>7. Create high-value downloadable resources for learners.</h3>



<p>Downloadable resources, like PDFs and infographics, remain popular with many learners. Users like the idea that they have something to take home with them—something they can reference for their own use, or share with others. You might release a piece of downloadable content every month or so to send to your learners—something they can print out to keep at their work station, or a worksheet they can fill out as an exercise.</p>



<h3>8. Build interactive elements into your course.</h3>



<p>Finally, consider researching the options currently available to add <a href="https://www.learndash.com/use-h5p-for-engaging-learndash-courses-2/">interactivity</a> to your course, and look at whether or not these tools would be useful for your own course. These might include flashcards, interactive videos, and branching scenarios. Creating resources that learners can work with inside your course can help make content more memorable.</p>



<h3>To be a successful online educator, you need to keep looking for ways to provide value to your learners.</h3>



<p>Success in online education almost always requires personal involvement. And this only becomes more true the more you build a brand around yourself and reasons why learners should turn to you for guidance. While finding ways to continue delivering value to your learners is a challenge, it’s also the only way you will retain them long-term.</p>



<p>The good news is that, if you are successful in establishing your expertise, your time will become more valuable. Selling courses becomes easier, and your reputation as a thought leader becomes easier to maintain.</p>



<p>But that will only happen if you’re providing real value to your learners. By continually reinvesting in your course and your course community, you demonstrate your commitment to delivering high-quality material for the long term. And that’s the kind of commitment your learners are most likely to reciprocate.</p>

<h2>There’s a lot of free content online, but it can’t replace instructor-led learning.</h2>



<p>Recently someone left a comment on the blog asking a very provocative question. Our commenter wanted to know whether a certain type of course content was still relevant, given the number of tutorials learners could find for free on the same subject on YouTube. Although this comment was related to a specific type of course, the question applies to almost all online learning.</p>



<p>YouTube is full of videos about any number of subjects, from dance tutorials, to cooking shows, art classes, leadership seminars, language lessons, computer programming courses, and more.</p>



<p>And it’s not just YouTube. You can find this content all around the Internet. So with everything available for free, who’s going to pay for your course?</p>



<p>I believe there are a lot of good answers to this question. But I also believe that many would-be educators give up on online education before they begin because they don’t think they&#8217;ll be successful. So, if you’re on the fence, here are my top reasons why you should consider launching a course and not worry about what others are giving away for free.</p>



<h3>1. Free content has never put teachers out of a job in the past.</h3>



<p>Probably the biggest misconception about online education is that, once learners have the content, they won’t stay for the instruction. While this might be true in theory, the reality is that most people don’t learn well on their own. Even those of us who are <a href="https://www.learndash.com/6-ways-help-motivate-learners-course/">highly motivated</a> do better with guidance, instruction, and outside feedback.</p>



<p>After all, free information is nothing new, but the existence of public libraries hasn’t made teachers redundant. As anyone with any knowledge of instructional design will tell you, delivering information isn’t the same as teaching it.</p>



<h3>2. The value of an online course extends beyond the content.</h3>



<p>There is one kind of course creator who should feel threatened by all the free content on YouTube, and that is the kind of instructor whose whole course is just a series of YouTube videos. In reality, most courses are comprised of much more than that. After all, YouTube content is passive. It does nothing to check how well learners have mastered the material.</p>



<p><strong>On a very concrete level, online courses add value to content by providing:</strong></p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.learndash.com/tips-for-writing-smarter-e-learning-quizzes/">Quizzes and feedback</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-include-interactive-elements-in-online-courses/">Interactive content</a>.</li><li>PDFs and other downloadable resources.</li><li>Certification.</li></ul>



<p>However, there’s also a soft component to this. As I said earlier, few learners do well on their own. And even those who <em>can</em> learn on their own often prefer to work with others. That’s because the social side of learning can make the process more enjoyable while also achieving better outcomes.</p>



<p><strong>In terms of soft skills, online courses add value to content by providing:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Motivation.</li><li><a href="https://www.learndash.com/are-you-selling-courses-or-community/">Community</a>.</li><li>Accountability.</li><li><a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-give-feedback-on-assessments/">Individual feedback</a>.</li></ul>



<p>If your course isn’t providing value in either or both of these areas, then it’s time to rethink your course.</p>



<h3>3. Learners are looking for trusted resources. Your perspective and expertise matter.</h3>



<p>One of the most valuable things a good online course can provide is structure. A learner working through content on their own has to decide for themself what content is trustworthy. They may struggle to find content that is appropriate for their skill level, or that covers the material in a consecutive fashion. They may feel one topic is covered extensively, while another is glossed over. Tracking down free content that answers all their questions takes time, and they may not even realize there are gaps in their knowledge, because they don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>As a course creator, you bring organization to the chaos. But you also bring a unique perspective to what material is taught, and how it is presented. This is most true in coaching and lifestyle courses, where the instructor may have a reputation and a certain level of prestige. But even if you aren’t known for your personal brand (yet!), your beliefs about how your subject should be taught are a selling point.</p>



<h3>4. There’s always more to learn—and plenty of it isn’t on YouTube.</h3>



<p>Remember how I just mentioned the gaps that can often be found in YouTube content? For all the videos that have been uploaded to the site, it isn’t hard to get so specific in your search queries that you hit the limit of available material. I’ve done this numerous times—in trying to find resources for drafting sewing patterns, in looking up spoken examples of rare dialects, in searching for explanations on how to use an unusual ingredient when cooking.</p>



<p>Even when I find a video, it’s often the case that it isn’t detailed enough, or that it’s poor quality. A lot of YouTube content is fairly surface level. While it’s easy to find incredibly niche videos, those videos may not be relevant to a learner’s needs. Online courses can fill in the gaps.</p>



<h3>5. YouTube isn’t new, but it hasn’t slowed the growth of online education.</h3>



<p>If you need one final point, consider this: The global online education market is projected to be worth nearly <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201103005255/en/Global-Online-Education-Market-Worth-USD-247.46-billion-by-2024-%E2%80%93-APAC-Anticipated-to-Provide-the-Highest-Revenue-Generating-Opportunities-%C2%A0Technavio">250 <em>billion</em> USD</a> by 2024. That’s how much people are willing to pay for education, over and above the high quality videos that are available for free.</p>



<h3>More often than not, free content feeds the desire for paid content.</h3>



<p>While it may seem counterintuitive, online educators shouldn’t view YouTube as the competition. Sure, there may be some course creators on YouTube who are competition, but this is far from clear cut. Instead, the free content on YouTube is more likely to be driving interest in paid content.</p>



<p>A person who knows nothing about cooking may begin their journey by googling a YouTube video for how to poach an egg. Their curiosity might then lead them to a recipe for shakshuka. Pretty soon, they’re buying cookbooks and signing up for your class on canning and preserving food. They still look up plenty of videos on YouTube, but nothing can replace the network of friends they’ve found in the forum on your community page, who are willing to answer their questions and celebrate with them when a recipe turns out well. They&#8217;re even looking forward to your upcoming jam and jelly-making course, in which you take them through a whole year of preserving seasonal foods.</p>



<p>In short, online instruction is about more than delivering information. Provide value, and your learners will pay for it.</p>

<h2>Ready to take your course to the next level in 2021? Here are some ideas for how to improve.</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s a new year, and for most business owners, that means it&#8217;s time to reflect on how far they&#8217;ve come since the previous year, and where they hope to go in the year to come. While New Year&#8217;s Resolutions are notoriously difficult to keep, when it comes to your online course, setting just one or two major goals for the year on top of what you&#8217;re already accomplishing can get you a long way. The question is, what kind of goals should you set for this year?</p>



<p>Of course, everyone will have their own priorities, many based on their specific business model. But if you&#8217;re looking for inspiration, here are five areas which we think might be productive places for growth in the new year.</p>



<h3>1. Learn about—and implement—a new instructional design concept.</h3>



<p>Innovation doesn&#8217;t have to come with fancy gimmicks. It can also come from presenting content in a way you hadn&#8217;t thought of before. Many of our users are content experts, meaning they understand the material they&#8217;re presenting very well. But it doesn&#8217;t follow that they&#8217;re educational experts. In other words, knowing your material doesn&#8217;t guarantee you can teach it effectively.</p>



<p>One of the best things you can do, if you feel you are in this category, is to read more about educational techniques. The more you know about how your learner&#8217;s learn, the better equipped you will be to teach them.</p>



<p><strong>A few of our favorite blogs on the topic include:</strong></p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.learndash.com/combating-the-forgetting-curve-in-online-education/">Combatting the Forgetting Curve in Online Education</a></li><li><a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-assumptions-of-adult-learners/">5 Assumptions of Adult Learners</a></li><li><a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-major-learning-styles-which-one-is-you/">7 Major Learning Styles and the 1 Big Mistake Everyone Makes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.learndash.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=24421&amp;action=edit">How Understanding Cognitive Load can Improve Your Course</a></li></ul>



<h3>2. Add a new element to your marketing strategy.</h3>



<p>Satisfied with your course but struggling to grow an audience? Marketing seems to be a &#8220;love it or hate it&#8221; task for many online educators. Those who enjoy marketing their courses can sometimes go overboard, trying too many things at once. And those who hate it can fall below even the minimum threshold of valuable activity.</p>



<p>This year, begin with an audit of your current marketing efforts. What are you doing well, and what is demonstrating traction? Keep those in your plan. Then think of one other element you can add to your <a href="https://www.learndash.com/4-tips-to-market-and-sell-courses-online/">marketing strategy</a> that you could do really well. If you&#8217;re already blogging, keep blogging but think about writing a downloadable guide. If you&#8217;re consistently posting to Facebook, think about adding an Instagram account. (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/learndash/">We did!</a>) If you&#8217;re maintaining a healthy email marketing list, think about running some advertisements.</p>



<h3>3. Improve an area of your learner experience that’s been holding you back.</h3>



<p>You know those minor irritants that you keep putting off fixing because they don&#8217;t every seem quite as important as the task at hand but are nevertheless a struggle every time you engage with them? Maybe it&#8217;s a task you have to do manually but you wish you could automate. Maybe it&#8217;s part of your template design that looks dated and needs a refresh. Maybe it&#8217;s a missing link in your <a href="https://www.learndash.com/6-notification-automations-to-help-with-learner-support/">learner support</a> strategy.</p>



<p>Addressing this task won&#8217;t just clear up an irritation, it will also free you to do more of the work you want to do, and leave learners with a more positive experience. Make this the year you stop putting it off.</p>



<h3>4. Experiment with a new technology.</h3>



<p>While we often caution our users not to let the promise of a fancy new piece of technology distract them from mastering the basics, those who are ready for something more advanced have a lot of interesting options to consider. Innovating in your course design by incorporating something new, like <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-use-branching-scenarios-in-e-learning/">branching scenarios</a>, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-include-interactive-elements-in-online-courses/">interactive content</a>, or even <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-ways-to-use-augmented-reality-in-the-classroom/">augmented reality</a>, can not only set you apart from the competition—it can also create a better experience for your learners.</p>



<h3>5. Involve yourself in a new way.</h3>



<p>One of the big ideas behind online education is the promise that it can free up repeatable tasks, like giving lectures or grading quizzes, leaving instructors with more time to devote to individual learners. However, it usually takes instructors a while to get each new course off the ground, meaning that individual time never seems to arrive.</p>



<p>This is a shame, because even a little bit of one-on-one time can keep learners engaged and greatly enhance the value of your course. If this isn&#8217;t something you can offer, taking a more prominent role on your blog, on social media, or in a private newsletter can help you connect with your audience and create greater learner buy-in. You may find that learners are more interested in signing up for a one-off webinar with you than in a whole new course.</p>



<h3>Making progress doesn’t have to be perfect—it just has to move the needle.</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;ve ever looked back on old lists of New Year&#8217;s Resolutions, you might notice a trend: you never accomplish everything you thought you would, but you do accomplish some of it. While you may not achieve your most aspirational goals, taking a moment to think about where you want to go can keep you from treading water—and from letting your attention scatter in too many places at once.</p>



<p>At the very least, trying new ideas will give you a sense for what&#8217;s worthwhile and what isn&#8217;t. You may decide to try a new lesson style that doesn&#8217;t pan out, in which case there&#8217;s no need to pursue that goal. Or you may realize that one of your marketing strategies is more effective than you expected, which is a sign you ought to double down and put more of your energy in that direction.</p>



<p>However you choose to tackle your goals this year, we wish you the best of luck. Happy 2021.</p>
